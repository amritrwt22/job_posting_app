/*explain this page
This page exports the GET and POST handlers from the NextAuth authentication setup. 
It allows Next.js to handle authentication requests (like sign-in, sign-out, and session management) 
through the specified routes. By exporting these handlers, you enable your application to respond to 
authentication-related HTTP requests seamlessly, integrating user authentication into your Next.js app.

import { handlers } from "@/auth"; // Importing the authentication handlers from the auth module
