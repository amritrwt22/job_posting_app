/*EXPLANATION:

- "use client"; 
  This directive tells Next.js that this file is a Client Component, allowing it to use hooks and browser APIs.

What Does SessionProvider Do with JWT Strategy?
-SessionProvider is a React context provider from NextAuth that makes the user's authentication state 
(the "session") available throughout your React component tree.

-With JWT strategy, the session data is not stored on your server or in a databaseâ€”
it's encoded in a JWT, which is stored in a cookie on the client.

When your app needs to know if a user is logged in (for example, to show/hide UI or protect a route),
it uses the session data from the JWT via useSession() or getSession()

What is stored?	            Where?	            How is it accessed in React?
JWT (with user info)	Client-side cookie	   SessionProvider + useSession()
Server session	         Database	           SessionProvider + useSession()
