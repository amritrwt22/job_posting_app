Feature                        What it Does
JWT Session                	Stores user session data in a signed token, not the database
GitHub Provider	            Lets users sign in with GitHub
PrismaAdapter	            Connects NextAuth to your database via Prisma ORM
jwt callback	            Adds user info (id, name) to the JWT after login
session callback	        Makes user info available in the session object sent to the client

This page configures authentication for your app, using GitHub for login, Prisma for database access, 
and custom callbacks to ensure user info is available in both the JWT and session objects
